# PowerX: AI-Driven Decentralized Energy Sharing Network

## Overview

**PowerX** is a decentralized, AI-powered energy-sharing platform that allows smart homes to share excess energy in real-time. The system leverages IoT-enabled smart meters to track energy production and consumption, while blockchain ensures secure and transparent energy transactions between homes. The goal of PowerX is to create a community-driven energy network that optimizes renewable energy usage, reduces waste, and promotes sustainability.

## Features

- **Real-Time Energy Sharing**: AI algorithms predict energy needs and redistribute surplus energy across homes in the network.
- **Blockchain-Based Energy Transactions**: Energy exchange is managed through a transparent and secure token system using blockchain.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Machine learning models forecast energy demand based on consumption patterns and weather data.
- **Community-Level Energy Storage**: Surplus energy is stored in batteries to act as a backup during peak demand periods.
- **Energy Token Rewards**: Homes earn tokens for contributing excess energy, which can be used for future energy needs or bill credits.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PowerX.git
cd PowerX
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.x**, **Node.js**, and **npm** installed. Then, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt     # For Python dependencies (AI, data analysis)
npm install                         # For Node.js dependencies (API, front-end)
```

### 3. Blockchain Setup
If using Ethereum, install **Truffle** for managing smart contracts:
```
npm install -g truffle
truffle init
```
Deploy the smart contract by running:
```
truffle migrate --network your_network
```

### 4. Run the Application
To start the back-end and front-end services:
```
npm run start-backend      # Starts Node.js back-end server
npm run start-frontend     # Starts React front-end UI
```

### 5. IoT and Smart Meter Setup
- Connect the **smart meter hardware** (Raspberry Pi / Arduino) to monitor energy consumption and production.
- Use **MQTT** or any messaging protocol to send data to the back-end in real-time.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Energy Monitoring
- IoT-enabled smart meters track energy production (from solar/wind) and consumption in real-time.
- Data is sent to the cloud platform for analysis.

### 2. AI-Based Prediction
- Machine learning models predict future energy consumption based on:
  - Historical consumption data.
  - Weather patterns (for solar/wind predictions).
- The AI system uses this data to suggest optimal energy redistribution across the network.

### 3. Blockchain-Based Energy Sharing
- Smart contracts on **Ethereum / Hyperledger** enable energy token transactions.
- Homes can buy, sell, or trade energy based on real-time supply and demand.

### 4. Community Energy Storage
- Surplus energy is stored in **community-level batteries** and used during periods of high demand or low production.

## Usage

1. **Monitor Energy Usage**: IoT smart meters send real-time energy data to the PowerX platform.
2. **Redistribute Energy**: The AI algorithm predicts and redistributes excess energy to homes that need it.
3. **Earn Tokens**: Homes that share their surplus energy receive blockchain-based energy tokens.
4. **Backup Energy**: Stored energy from community batteries is used during peak times or emergencies.
